### Digital Texts as Data

In this session we will introduce programming by looking at how data can be manipulated, counted, and mined using the Unix shell, a command line interface to your computer and the files it has access to.

A Unix shell is a command-line interpreter that provides a user interface for the Linux operating system and for Unix-like systems (such as iOS). For Windows users, popular shells such as Cygwin or Git Bash provide a Unix-like interface (a command line interface preferable - to me at least - to Windows own flavour of command line). This session will cover a small number of basic commands using Git Bash for Windows users, Terminal for iOS. These commands constitute building blocks upon which more complex commands can be constructed to fit your data or project.

We'll be covering quite a lot but the key commands are in the handout for reference. We'll proceed in a follow my leader fashion. The format will be that I'll demo a command, you copy, and then we'll discuss the results. Stickies for when you get stuck or something doesn't appear to work.

### Shell: one approach to working with data

#### Basics I

**SLIDE** We will begin with the basics of navigating the Unix shell.

Start by opening your shell. When you run it, you will likely see a black window with a cursor flashing next to a dollar sign. This is our command line.

If, when opening a command window or at any other time today, you are unsure of where you are in a computer's file system, you can find out what directory you are in using `pwd` command, which stands for "print working directory", and hitting enter - which executes commands in the shell. Try typing `pwd` and hitting enter.

To orient ourselves, let's get a listing of what files are in this directory. Type `ls` and you will see a list of every file and directory within your current location.

You may want more information than just a list of files. You can do this by specifying various *flags* to go with our basic commands. These are additions to a command that provide the computer with a bit more guidance of what sort of output or manipulation you want.

If you type `ls -l` and hit enter the computer returns a long list of files that contains information similar to what you'd find in your finder or explorer: the size of the files in bytes, the date it was created or last modified, and the file name.

In everyday usage you will be more used to units of measurement like kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes. Luckily, there's another flag `-h` that when used with the -l option, use unit suffixes: Byte, Kilobyte, Megabyte, Gigabyte, Terabyte and Petabyte in order to reduce the number of digits to three or less using base 2 for sizes.

Now `ls -h` won't work on its own. When you want to use two flags, you can just run them together. So, by typing `ls -lh` and hitting enter you receive an output in a human-readable format (note: that the order here doesn't matter).

You've now spent a great deal of time in your home directory. Let's go somewhere else. You can do that through the `cd` or Change Directory command. 

If you type `cd desktop` you are now on your desktop *note: for Windows users, the case of the file/directory doesn't matter. For Linux users like me, it does, and I believe that is the same for Mac people*. To double check, type `pwd` and you should see something that represents your desktop.

You'll note that this only takes you 'down' through your directory structure (as in into more nested directories). If you want to go back, you can type `cd ..`. This moves us 'up' one directory, putting us back where we started. If you ever get completely lost, the command `cd --` will bring you right back to the home directory, right where you started.

Try exploring: move around the computer, get used to moving in and out of directories, see how different file types appear in the Unix shell. **TWO MINUTES**

Being able to navigate your file system using the bash shell is very important for using the Unix shell effectively. And as you become more comfortable, you'll soon find yourself skipping directly to the directory that you want.

_____
#### Summary

Within the Unix shell you can now:

- use the command `pwd` to find out where you are in on your computer
- use the command `ls` to list directory contents
- use flags `-l` and `-lh` to guide the output of the `ls` command
- use the command `cd` to move around your computer

______
### Basics II

**SLIDE** As well as navigating directories, you can interact with files on the command line: you can read them, open them, run them, and even edit them, often without ever having to leave the interface. Sometimes it is easier to do this using a Graphical User Interface, such as Word or your normal explorer, but the more you work here the more it is useful and the more you write scripts the more you'll need this basic knowledge

Here's a few basic ways to interact with files. 

First, you can create a new directory. For convenience's sake, we will create it in directory you extracted the data provided in advance. Here type `mkdir firstdir` and hit enter. This used the `mkdir` command (meaning 'Making Directory') to create a directory named 'firstdir'. Now, move into that directory using the `cd` command.

But wait! There's a trick to make things a bit quicker. Go up one directory (`cd ..`). To navigate to the `firstdir` directory you could type `cd firstdir`. Alternatively, you could type `cd f` and then hit tab. You will notice that the interface completes the line to `cd firstdir`. **Hitting tab at any time within the shell will prompt it to attempt to auto-complete the line based on the files or sub-directories in the current directory. Where two or more files have the same characters, the auto-complete will only fill up to the first point of difference, after which you can add more characters, and try using tab again. We would encourage using this method throughout today to see how it behaves (as it saves loads of time and effort!).**

The next step is to manipulate files.

Navigate to the `text` directory in the pre-circulated data directory. In here there is a copy of Jonathan Swift's *Gulliver's Travels* downloaded from Project Gutenberg. type `ls -lh` and hit enter to see details of this file.

You can read the text right here. To try this, type `cat 829-0.txt`. The terminal window erupts and *Gulliver's Travels* cascades by: this is what is known as printing to the shell. And it is great, in theory, but you can't really make any sense of that amount of text. Instead, you may want to just look at the first or the last bit of the file. **TIP: to cancel this print of `829-0.txt`, or indeed any ongoing in the Unix shell, hit `ctrl+c`**

Type `head 829-0.txt` and hit enter. This provides a view of the first ten lines, whereas `tail 829-0.txt` provides a perspective on the last ten lines. This is a good way to quickly determine the contents of the file.

You may also want to change the file name to something more descriptive. You can 'move' it to a new name by using the `mv` or move command. To do this type `mv 829-0.txt gulliver.txt` and hit enter.

Afterwards, when you perform a `ls` command, you will see that it is now `gulliver.txt`. Had you wanted to duplicate it, you could have used the `cp` or copy command by typing `cp 829-0.txt gulliver.txt`

Now that you have seen and used several new commands, it's time for another trick. Hit the up arrow twice on your keyboard. Notice that `mv 829-0.txt gulliver.txt` appears before your cursor. You can continue pressing the up arrow to cycle through your previous commands. The down arrow cycles back toward your most recent command. This is another important labour saving function and something we'll use a lot this evening.

After having read and renamed several files, you may wish to bring their text together into one file. Before we do that let's use `cp` to duplicate the Gulliver file and give it the filename `gulliver-backup.txt`: any ideas how you do that? (**ANSWER**: `cp gulliver.txt gulliver-backup.txt`). Good, now that you have two copies of *Gulliver's Travels*, let's put them together to make an **even longer** book. 

To combine, or concatenate, two or more files use the `cat` command again. Type `cat gulliver.txt gulliver-backup.txt` and press enter. This prints, or displays, the combined files within the shell. However, it is too long to read on this window! Luckily, by using the `>` redirector, you can send the output to a new file, rather than the terminal window. Hit up to get to your last command and amend the line to `cat gulliver.txt gulliver-backup.txt > gulliver-twice.txt` and hit enter. Now, when you type `ls` you'll see `gulliver-twice.txt` appear in your directory.

When combining more than two files, using a wildcard can help avoid having to write out each filename individually. Again, labour saving! A useful wildcard is `*` which is a place holder for zero or more characters or numbers (note: this is slightly different from regex...). So, if you type `cat *.txt > everything-together.txt` and hit enter, a combination of all the `.txt` files in the current directory are combined in alphabetical order as `everything-together.txt`. This can be very useful if you need to combine a large number of smaller file within a directory so that you can work with them in a text analysis program. Another wildcard worth remembering is `?` which is a place holder for a single character or number. We shall return to shell wildcards later - for now, note again that they are similar to but not the same as the Regex we saw last week.

Finally, onto deleting. We won't use the now, but if you do want to delete a file, for whatever reason, the command is `rm`, or remove. **Be careful with the `rm` command**, as you don't want to delete files that you do not mean to. Unlike deleting from within your Graphical User Interface, there is **no** recycling bin or undo options. For that reason, if you are in doubt, you may want to exercise caution or maintain a regular backup of your data.

The syntax for `rm` is the same as `cp` and `mv`: for example `rm gulliver.txt`, adding wildcards as appropriate to specify the files to delete.

______
#### Summary

Within the Unix shell you can now:

- use the command `mv` to rename and move files.
- use the command `cp` to create a file from an existing file.
- use the command `cat` to combine more than one file of the same file type.
- use the wildcards `*` and `?` as place holders that delimit which files are to be manipulated by a given an action.
- use the `rm` command to delete unwanted files.

## Afternoon

**SLIDE** Now you can work with the unix shell you can move onto learning how to count and mine data. These are rather simple and are unlikely to totally revolutionise your research. They are, however, alongside the consistent file structure and naming I touched on last week, the foundation of a more powerful set of commands that can count and mine data you may come across.

______
#### Counting and Mining Texts

You will begin by counting the contents of files using the Unix shell. The Unix shell can be used to quickly generate counts from across files, something that is tricky to achieve using the graphical user interfaces of standard office suites.

In the Unix shell, use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory that contains our data: the `tabular` subdirectory of the `...digitext` directory. Remember, if at any time you are not sure where you are in your directory structure, type `pwd` and hit enter.

Type `ls -lh` and then hit enter. This prints, or displays, a list that includes a file and a subdirectory.

The file in this directory is the dataset `2015-06-16_BL-Microsoftbooks-list.tsv` that metadata for nearly 50k 17th, 18th, and 19th century books digitsed by Microsoft in partnership with the British Library.

The subdirectory is named `derived_data`. It contains two .tsv files derived from `2015-06-16_BL-Microsoftbooks-list.tsv` by keyword appearance. The `derived_data` directory also includes a subdirectory called `results`.

*Note: TSV files are those in which within each row the units of data (or cells) are separated by tabs. They are similar to CSV (comma seperated value) files were the values are separated by commas. The latter are more common but can cause problems with the kind of data we have, where commas can be found within the cells (though with the right encoding this can be overcome). Either way both can be read in simple text editors or in spreadsheet programs such as Libre Office Calc or Microsoft Excel.*

Before you begin working with these files, you should move into the directory in which they are stored. Navigate to `...digitext/tabular/derived_data` directory.

Now that you are here you can count the contents of the files.

The Unix command for counting is `wc`. Type `wc -w 2015-06-16_BL-Microsoftbooks-list-paris.tsv` and hit enter. The flag `-w` combined with `wc` instructs the computer to print a word count, and the name of the file that has been counted, into the shell.

As was seen earlier today flags such as `-w` are an essential part of getting the most out of the Unix shell as they give you better control over commands.

If your reader request or piece of work is more concerned number of entries (or lines) than the number of words, you can use the line count flag. Type `wc -l 2015-06-16_BL-Microsoftbooks-list-paris.tsv` and hit enter. Combined with `wc` the flag `-l` prints a line count and the name of the file that has been counted.

Finally, type `wc -c 2015-06-16_BL-Microsoftbooks-list-paris.tsv` and hit enter. This uses the flag `-c` in combination with the command `wc` to print a character count for `2015-06-16_BL-Microsoftbooks-list-paris.tsv` *Note: OS X users should replace the -c flag with -m.*

With these three flags, the most obvious thing we can use `wc` for is to quickly compare the shape of sources in digital format - for example word counts per page of a book, the distribution of characters per page across a collection of newspapers, the average line lengths used by poets. You can also use `wc` with a combination of wildcards and flags to build more complex queries.

Can you guess what the line `wc -l *.tsv` will do? Correct! This prints the line counts for `2015-06-16_BL-Microsoftbooks-list-paris.tsv` and `2015-06-16_BL-Microsoftbooks-list-london.tsv`, offering a simple means of comparing these two sets of research data. Of course, it may be faster if you only have a handful of files to compare the line count for the two documents in Libre Office Calc, Microsoft Excel, or a similar spreadsheet program. But when wishing to compare the line count for tens, hundreds, or thousands of documents, the Unix shell has a clear speed advantage.

Moreover, as our datasets increase in size you can use the Unix shell to do more than copy these line counts by hand, by the use of print screen, or by copy and paste methods. Using the `>` redirect operator we saw earlier you can export our query results to a new file. Type `wc -l *.tsv > results/FOOBAR.txt` (or something like that, the last bit after `results/` could be anything!) and hit enter. This runs the same query as before, but rather than print the results within the Unix shell it saves the results as `FOOBAR.txt`. By prefacing this with `results/` the shelll is instructed to save the .txt file to the `results` sub-directory. To check this, navigate to the `results` subdirectory, hit enter, type `ls`, and hit enter again to see this file. Type `FOOBAR.txt` to see the file contents in the shell (as it is 10 lines or fewer in length, all the file contents will be shown here).

______
#### Mining

The Unix shell can do much more than count the words, characters, and lines within a file. The `grep` command (meaning 'global regular expression print') is used to search across multiple files for specific strings of characters. It is able to do so much faster than the graphical search interface offered by most operating systems or office suites. And combined with the `>` operator, the `grep` command becomes a powerful research tool can be used to mine your data for characteristics or word clusters that appear across multiple files and then export that data to a new file. The only limitations here are your imagination, the shape of your data, and - when working with thousands or millions of files - the processing power at your disposal.

To begin using `grep`, first navigate to the `derived_data` directory (`cd ..`). Here type `grep 1832 *.tsv` and hit enter. This query looks across all files in the directory that fit the given criteria (the .tsv files) for instances of the string, or character cluster, '1832'. It then prints them within the shell.

Press the up arrow once in order to cycle back to your most recent action. Amend `grep 1832 *.tsv` to `grep -c 1832 *.tsv` and hit enter. The shell now prints the number of times the string 1832 appeared in each `*.tsv file`. If you look at the output from the previous command, this tends to be refer to the date field of each book title.

Strings need not be numbers. `grep -c revolution *.tsv`, for example, counts the instances of the string `revolution` within the defined files and prints those counts to the shell. Run this, observe the output, and then amend it to `grep -ci revolution *.tsv`. This repeats the query, but prints a case insensitive count (including instances of both `revolution` and `Revolution`). Note how the count has increased. As before, cycling back and adding `> results/`, followed by a filename (ideally in .txt format), will save the results to a data file.

So far we have counted strings in file and printed to the shell or to file those counts. But the real power of `grep` comes in that you can also use it to create subsets of tabulated data (or indeed any data) from one or multiple files. Type `grep -i revolution *.tsv` and hit enter. This script looks in the defined files and prints any lines containing `revolution` (without regard to case) to the shell. `grep -i revolution *.tsv > results/FOOBAR-revolution.tsv` saves it to file.

However if we look at this file, it contains every instance of the string 'revolution' including as a single word and as part of other words such as 'revolutionary'. This perhaps isn't as useful as we thought... Thankfully, the `-w` flag instructs `grep` to look for whole words only, giving us greater precision in our search. Type `grep -iw revolution *.tsv > results/FOOBAR-revolution.tsv` and hit enter. This script looks in both of the defined files and exports any lines containing the whole word `revolution` (without regard to case) to the specified .tsv file. `wc -l *revolution` shows us the difference between them.

______
#### Exercise

With the person next to you, select a word to search for and use what you have learnt do to the following:

Search for all case sensitive instances of that word in the 'london' file. Print you results to the shell.

- `grep hero NAME.tsv`

Search for all case sensitive instances of that word in the 'london' file. Print you results to the shell.

- `grep hero NAME.tsv`

Count all case sensitive instances of that word in both tsv files in this directory. Print you results to the shell.

- `grep -c hero *.tsv`

Count all case insensitive instances of that word in both tsv files in this directory. Print you results to the shell.

- `grep -ci hero *.tsv`

Search for all case insensitive instances of that word in both tsv files in this directory. Print you results to a new .tsv file. 

- `grep -i hero *.tsv > new.tsv`

Search for all case insensitive instances of that whole word in both tsv files in this directory. Print you results to a new .tsv file.

- `grep -iw hero *.tsv > new2.tsv`

Compare the line counts of the last two files.

- `wc -l FILENAMES`

Open both files in a text editor (Notepad++, Atom, Kate, whatever you prefer) or Excel-like program to see the difference between searching strings and searching whole words using `grep`

______
#### Recap

Within the Unix shell you can now:

- use the `wc` command with the flags `-w` and `-l` to count the words and lines in a file or a series of files.
- use the redirector and structure `> subdirectory/filename` to save results into a subdirectory.
- use the `grep` command to search for instances of a string.
- use with `grep` the `-c` flag to count instances of a string, the `-i` flag to return a case insensitive search for a string, the `-v` flag to exclude a string from the results, and -w to return a whole word only search
- combine these commands and flags to build complex queries in a way that suggests the potential for using the Unix shell to count and mine your research data and research projects.

### Ripping a Text Apart

**SLIDE** So far we have looked at how to use the Unix shell to manipulate, count, and mine tabulated data. Most data, especially digitised documents used in research, are much messier book metadata. Nonetheless many of the same techniques can be applied to non-tabulated data, such as free text, we just need to think carefully about what it is we are counting and how we can get the best out of the Unix shell. 

Thankfully there are plenty of folks out there doing this sort of work and we can borrow what they do as an introduction to working with these more complex files. So for this final exercise we're going to leap forward a little in terms of difficulty to an scenario where we won't learn about everything that is happening in detail or discuss at length each command. We're going to prepare and pull apart a text to show the potential of using the Unix shell in research. And where commands we've learnt about are used, I've left some of the figuring out to do to you - so please refer to your notes if you get stuck!

**NB: leave 10 minutes at the end to go through final bits**

_____
#### Grabbing a text, cleaning it up

*Work on this exercise with the person next to you*

Head to `.../digitext/text/`. We're going to work again with the `gulliver.txt` file we saw earlier.

**SHOW THE FILE WITH `less -N gulliver.txt`**

We're going to start by using the `sed` command. The command allows you to edit files directly.

Type `sed '9352,9714d' gulliver.txt > gulliver-nofoot.txt` and hit enter.

The command `sed` in combination with the `d` value will look at `gulliver.txt` and delete all values between the rows specified. The `>` action then prompts the script to this edited text to the new file specified.

Now type `sed '1,37d' gulliver-nofoot.txt > gulliver-noheadfoot.txt` and hit enter. This does the same as before, but for the header.

You now have a cleaner text. The next step is to prepare it even further for rigorous analysis.

We now use the `tr` command, used for translating or deleting characters. Type `tr -d [:punct:] < gulliver-noheadfoot.txt > gulliver-noheadfootpunct.txt` and hit enter.

This uses the translate command and a special syntax to remove all punctuation. It also requires the use of both the output redirect `>` we have seen and the input redirect `<` we haven't seen. 

Finally regularise the text by removing all the uppercase lettering. Type `tr [:upper:] [:lower:] < gulliver-noheadfootpunct.txt > gulliver-clean.txt` and hit enter.

Open the `gulliver-clean.txt` in a text editor. Note how the text has been transformed ready for analysis.

______
#### Pulling a text apart, counting word frequencies

We are now ready to pull the text apart.

Type `tr ' ' '\n' < gulliver-clean.txt > gulliver-linebyline.txt` and hit enter.

This uses the translate command again, this time to translate every blank space into `\n` which renders as a new line. Every word in the file will now have its own line.

This isn't much use, so to get a better sense of the data we need to use another new command called `sort`. Type `sort gulliver-linebyline.txt > gulliver-ordered.txt` and hit enter.

This script uses the `sort` command to rearrange the text from its original order into an alphabetical configuration. Open the file in a text editor and after scrolling past some blank space you will begin to see some numbers and finally words, or at least lots of copies of 'a'!

This is looking more useful, but we can go one step further. Type `uniq -c gulliver-ordered.txt > gulliver-final.txt` and hit enter.

This script uses `uniq`, another new command, in combination with the `-c` flag to both remove duplicate lines and produce a word count of those duplicates.

**Note: there is a windows/linux issue here worth flagging about special characters**

**SLIDE** Note that these steps can be simplified by building 'pipes'. So...

`tr ' ' '\n' < gulliver-clean.txt | sort | uniq -c > gulliver-final.txt`

...would have done the line-by-line, sorting, and removal of duplicates in one go.

Either way we have now taken the text apart and produced a count for each word in it. This is data we can prod and poke and visualise, that can form the basis of our investigations, and can compare with other texts processed in the same way. And if we need to run a different set of transformation for a different analysis, we can return to `gulliver-clean.txt` to start that work

**note there are a few bits of punctuation in here - I've left these in deliberately as you should always bug fix! The internet is a always a good place to start searching for why this might have happened (something about the `punct` command we used...)**

And all this using a few commands on an otherwise unassuming but very powerful command line.

_____
### Finding People and Places

**SLIDE** Many digital humanists are beginning to use machines to tell them what sorts of elements a text - or a series of texts - contain. One popular process is Named Entity Recognition (or NER for short). This process looks at texts and makes a stab at finding the people and places it contains. As we shall see it is far from perfect, but it is an example of a process that you can run from the command line (increasing the utility of remembering what we've been up to today!)

So, although Named Entity Recognition relies on a number of processes we need to critique, it can be run across texts quickly and simply from the command line. We start by setting the named entity recognition running on a txt (here on a text with punctuation removed)

`stanford-ner/ner.sh gulliver-noheadfootpunct.txt > gulliver_ner.txt`

Looking at the text now, we can see that the NER has tagged some words with what it thinks are people, places, et al. We then clean up loose tags

`sed 's/\/O / /g' < gulliver_ner.txt > gulliver_ner-clean.txt`

From which we can count persons...

`egrep -o -f personpattr gulliver_ner-clean.txt | sed 's/\/PERSON//g' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > gulliver_ner-pers-freq.txt` *note: `egrep` is merely a variant of grep that looks for patterns*

And count places....

`egrep -o -f locpattr gulliver_ner-clean.txt | sed 's/\/LOCATION//g' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr > gulliver_ner-loc-freq.txt`

Now the results of this are up for debate. Many persons seem to me to be missing, suggesting the applicability of the software for this purpose may be questionable. But I hope you can see that the process is simple and can be reapplied to other textual data when you want to quickly get a sense of the people or places it contains. And that it is one of many tools (another useful one being `wget`, a command that enables you to archive webpages) that work well on the command line.

#### Conclusion

**SLIDE** In this session you have learned to navigate the Unix shell, to undertake some basic file counting, concatenation and deletion, to query across data for common strings, to save results and derived data, and to prepare textual data for rigorous computational analysis.

This only scratches the surface of what the Unix environment is capable of. It is hoped, however, that this session has provided a taster sufficient to prompt further investigation and productive play. 

Keep in mind that the full potential of the tools can offer may only emerge upon embedding these skills into real projects. Nonetheless, being able to manipulate, count and mine thousands on files is extremely useful. Even a large collection of files which do not contain any alpha-numeric data elements, such as image files, can be easily sorted, selected and queried depending on the amount of description, of metadata contained in each filename. If not a prerequisite of working with the Unix, then taking the time to structure your data in a consistent and predictable manner is certainly a significant step towards getting the most out of Unix commands. And if you can find a way of using the Unix shell regularly - perhaps only to copy or amend files - you'll keep the basics fresh, meaning that next time you have cause to use the Unix shell for more complex commands, you shouldn't need to learn it all over again.
